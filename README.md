# Digit_DNN_Classifier

A DNN model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates how to use a fully-connected Deep Neural Network (DNN) for image classification on the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow and Keras. The model learns to recognize digits (0–9) with high accuracy.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mnist-with-deep-neural-network.git
cd mnist-with-deep-neural-network
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed, then run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can generate this file using:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the notebook

Start Jupyter and open the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
