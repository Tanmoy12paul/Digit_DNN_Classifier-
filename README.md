# Digit_DNN_Classifier

A DNN model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
---

## ðŸ§  Network Architecture

The model uses a fully connected (dense) architecture:

- Input Layer: 784 neurons (28x28 pixels)
- Hidden Layers: Two fully connected layers with ReLU activation and dropout regularization
- Output Layer: 10 neurons (digits 0â€“9)
